    <font size="10px" face="ARIAL">M</font><font size="3px" face="ARIAL">uhammad Ali Jinnah, born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, was
      a towering political figure whose leadership led to the creation of Pakistan.Jinnah's early education took place in Bombay 
      (now Mumbai) and later in London, where he studied law at Lincoln's Inn. Returning to India, he
      quickly established himself as a successful. <br /><br />Jinnah initially joined the Indian National Congress in 1906, advocating
      for Hindu-Muslim unity and Indian self-governance. However, the growingdivide between Hindus and Muslims led him to join the All India Muslim
      League in 1913. Over time, he emerged as the primary spokesperson forMuslim interests, advocating for their rights and political
      representation. <br /><br />The 1930s and 1940s were transformative for Jinnah and the Indian
      political landscape. He articulated the Two-Nation Theory, arguing thatMuslims and Hindus were distinct nations with different religions,
      philosophies, social customs, and literature. This perspective was adriving force behind his demand for a separate Muslim state. His
      leadership in the Lahore Resolution of 1940 formalized this demand, layingthe foundation for Pakistan. <br /><br />
      Jinnah's unwavering commitment to the cause, despite personal healthchallenges, was pivotal. His negotiations with the British and the Indian
      National Congress, particularly with figures like Mahatma Gandhi andJawaharlal Nehru, were crucial in the eventual partition of India. On
      August 14, 1947, Pakistan emerged as an independent nation, with Jinnah as its first Governor-General and President of its Constituent Assembly.
      <br /><br />As "Quaid-e-Azam" (Great Leader), Jinnah's vision for Pakistanwas a democratic and inclusive state, emphasizing justice, equality, and
      fraternity. He worked tirelessly to stabilize the nascent country,focusing on nation-building and establishing governmental
      structures.</font><Br></Br>
